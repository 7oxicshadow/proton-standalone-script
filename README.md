# proton-standalone-script

Allows steam proton to be launched without steam (Standalone) [Native steam does need to be installed for controller support,
but will never be launched]

All of my testing was done with Proton GE but in theory it should work with any Proton version.

I originally created this because I wanted to test the status of VKD3D whitout having to mess around with lutris and other launchers.

Instructions for use is detailed inside the proton_launch.sh file. There is a section labelled "important", make sure you read it.

Note: Whilst there are only a few things inside the script that need to be adjusted its probably best suited to advanced users as it makes and assumption that you know what a prefix is and where it is stored.
